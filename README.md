# Snake-Chase

For a beginner project, I will create 2 of my own versions of the snake game.
1. This first game will be created mainly using javascript.
   I will be using little html elements with css to support the javascript code.
3. The second snake game will be created through python.
   I have learned the basics of python and going to try and put it to use and create a different version of the game
